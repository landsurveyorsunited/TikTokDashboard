This is the front end for a web dashboard which displays data and trends (total views, percent growth, etc.) in hashtags over time. The data is collected by separate automated backend services on a daily basis. 

Current features of the dashboard include:
- Unlimited user input of new hashtags to be tracked starting the following day
- User manipulation of the displayed graph to include or exclude user selected tags
- User selection of the type of displayed graph (total views, percent growth, etc.) over the user selected time period (days, weeks, months, etc.)
- "Trending" sections displaying the top 10 trending hashtags over various time periods (ex: top 10 fastest growing tags over the last week)
- User authentication
